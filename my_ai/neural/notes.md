### Perceptrons and Sigmoid

You can think of a perceptron as a function. Has inputs, does something with them, then it produces output.

Perceptrons. In fact, a small change in the weights or bias of any single perceptron in the network can sometimes cause the output of that perceptron to completely flip, say from 0 to 1.
Perceptrons take 0 or 1 as inputs.
Perceptrons produce 0 or 1 as output.

Sigmoid neurons are similar to perceptrons, but modified so that small changes in their weights and bias cause only a small change in their output.
Sigmoid takes any values between 0 and 1 as inputs.
Sigmoid neurons produce any value between 0 and 1 as output. The output is the return value of the sigmoid function.

Two activities:

* segmentation
* recognize and classify
