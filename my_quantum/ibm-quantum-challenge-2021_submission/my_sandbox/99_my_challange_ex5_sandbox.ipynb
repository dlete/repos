Use the qubit number reduction schemes available in Qiskit and find the optimal circuit for this larger system. Optimize the circuit and use your imagination to find ways to select the best building blocks of parameterized circuits and compose them to construct the most compact ansatz circuit for the ground state, better than the ones already available in Qiskit."

    "5. Ansatz. One of the most important choices is the quantum circuit that you choose to approximate your ground state. Here is the example of qiskit circuit library that contains many possibilities for making your own circuit.\n",
    "6. Backend. This is where you specify the simulator or device where you want to run your algorithm. We will focus on the statevector_simulator in this challenge.\n",
    "7. Optimizer. The optimizer guides the evolution of the parameters of the ansatz so it is very important to investigate the energy convergence as it would define the number of measurements that have to be performed on the QPU. A clever choice might reduce drastically the number of needed energy evaluations.\n",
    "8. Exact eigensolver. For learning purposes, we can solve the problem exactly with the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix so we know where to aim with VQE. Of course, the dimensions of this matrix scale exponentially in the number of molecular orbitals so you can try doing this for a large molecule of your choice and see how slow this becomes. For very large systems you would run out of memory trying to store their wavefunctions.\n",
    "9. VQE and initial parameters for the ansatz. Now we can import the VQE class and run the algorithm.\n",
    "9. Scoring function. We need to judge how good are your VQE simulations, your choice of ansatz/optimizer. For this, we implemented the following simple scoring function:"
